Modules

  AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) - RequireJS
  CommonJS - Browserify??? (also Node.js)

  The primary differences between CommonJS and AMD are as follows:

  CommonJS is synchronous in nature; AMD loads files asynchronously
  CommonJS is primarily used on the server in conjunction with node; AMD is most useful in the browser and its most popular implementation is RequireJS.

  You can configure the TS compiler to combine all compiled JS into a single file

  Information on file globbing
  	http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#globbing-patterns
  		"All most people need to know is that foo/*.js will match all files ending with .js in the foo/ subdirectory, but foo/**/*.js will match all files ending with .js in the foo/ subdirectory and all of its subdirectories."
